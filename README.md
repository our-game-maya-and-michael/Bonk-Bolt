# Bonk & Bolt

**Outrun, Outwit, Outlast - The Ultimate Game of Tag!**

## The essence of the game

Bonk & Bolt is an adrenaline-pumping multiplayer game. The players start in a room, after a 10-second countdown, fall into a vast area filled with obstacles and elevated terrains. One player is designated as the catcher, tasked with tagging others. The game ends with a dramatic display, signifying either the catcher's victory or the escape of remaining players.
