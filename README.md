# Bonk & Bolt

**Outrun, Outwit, Outlast - The Ultimate Game of Tag!**

Bonk & Bolt is an adrenaline-pumping multiplayer game where players start in a room and, after a 10-second countdown, fall into a vast area filled with obstacles and elevated terrains. One player is designated as the catcher, tasked with tagging others. Successful tags result in dynamic animations that eject players from the arena. The game ends with a dramatic display, signifying either the catcher's victory or the escape of remaining players.

Intended Platform: PC
