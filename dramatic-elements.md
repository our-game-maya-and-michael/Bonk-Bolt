# Dramatic Elements 


## Challenge

* To play the game, the player needs to plan a strategy to catch the other players, rather than catch them randomly.
* At the beginning of the game the player will manually choose between 2 options. The first option is a smooth movement of the player and the second option is a movement with physical components such as acceleration, which makes controlling the player more difficult, and the game more challenging.
* After choosing the mode of movement, there will be levels with different difficulty, while each level becomes more challenging.

## Flow

* To avoid distractions, the main graphics will be in the actual levels.
* The player completely controls the game as he moves his character using the keyboard and chases the other players.
* The feedback for success will be a transition screen where it is written that the player passed the level successfully and for failure there will also be a transition screen and the player will return to the same level again.

## Play
* To keep the player in focus on the game and also because of the pressure from the timer to complete the level as fast as you can, you cant do any-thing except from catch the other players.
* This game is supposed to be for the achievers because the more rounds you pass the harder the game gets.
* To make the game appeal to other sorts of players we can add a scoreboard to keep track of which player completed the level the fastes to bring competitive players and also add skins to the characters to try and get the collecters to play the game.

## Emotions

* The purpose of the game is to convey a childhood experience. Each one of us played catch with our friends or siblings, so the emotion we expect to feel is a childhood memory, excitement and joy.
In addition, the player will feel some adrenaline because the game is challenging and the desire to pass each level increases.
* In order to convey the experience of childhood, the graphics of the game will be in places where children play, for example at home with their siblings, at school with their friends or at a playground.

## Premise

* Since we want to focus on the levels themselves, and they tell the story we want the player to feel and see, there is no background story beyond the levels.

## Characters

* The characters in the game are the player who has to catch the other characters.
* The hero is the catcher who is actually the player himself and all the other characters that need to be caught are the opposing characters.
* During the game, the number of characters that need to be caught changes according to the difficulty of the level.
* The catcher is controled by the player and the other characters will move randomly using AI and try to escape from the catcher.

## Plot
* The plot will be very linear because there is no plot, its just a good old game of tag !
* There will be no plot but the more levels you complete the harder it will get.
* If the player will think stratigic and be quick on his feet to catch all of the other players he will advance to the next levels that are harder.

## World-Building

* Our world is a child's world with normal rules of physics.
* At the beginning of each phase with a new object or rule, there will be a demonstration of what the object does or what is allowed or prohibited within the new rule.
