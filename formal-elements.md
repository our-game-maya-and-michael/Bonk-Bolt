# Bonk & Bolt

**Outrun, Outwit, Outlast - The Ultimate Game of Tag!**

## The essence of the game 

Bonk & Bolt is an adrenaline-pumping multiplayer game where players start in a room and, after a 10-second countdown, fall into a vast area filled with obstacles and elevated terrains. One player is designated as the catcher, tasked with tagging others. Successful tags result in dynamic animations that eject players from the arena. The game ends with a dramatic display, signifying either the catcher's victory or the escape of remaining players.

Intended Platform: PC

*	Core Gameplay Loop: Players must navigate the dynamic arena, either evading the catcher or trying to catch others, using various obstacles and terrain to their advantage.
*	Game End Process: Winning involves either catching all players or being the last one uncaught. Players would use keyboard and mouse, with actions like running, jumping, or using special abilities like speed, invisibility, super-strength, super jump and etc.
*	Learning the Processes: Players learn about these processes through an interactive tutorial at the beginning, supplemented by tooltips and in-game guidance.

### 7. Boundaries
* World Boundaries: A semi-open arena on a flat surface with clearly defined limits because the whole arena will be up in the air so if you cross the boundaries you fall and lose.
* Map Design Principles: Every place has its strategic advantage like gitting to the top of a building will take some time for the catcher and also the runners, you can get to any part of the map but the higher places take a little more time to get to unless you have power-up, the map is pretty simple you are on a platform with high building and need to find players, every high place or shaddy area might contain runners for you to catch or be a good hiding spot from the cather, and if the catcher cant find the runners in the last 10 seconds the location of all the players are shown to the catcher by seeing through every thing in the map.

### 8. Outcomes

* Possible Outcomes: Victory for the catcher or successful escape for runners.
* Skill vs. Luck: The game balances skill (like knowing when to use power-ups) and luck (the catcher might slip and fall of the building before catching you), with a greater emphasis on player strategy.
* Game Nature: Primarily competitive, with cooperative elements among runners.
